This is swMutSel, a program to estimate fitnesses of amino acids in protein-
coding genes using the evolution model of Halpern and Bruno (1998) and Tamuri et
al. (2012, 2014). The program takes as input an alignment of protein-coding
gene sequences and a phylogeny (tree) of the sequences, and outputs the
fitnesses of each amino acid at each location in the protein-coding gene.
